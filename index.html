<h1>Refugees on Rails / Leipzig</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>Refugees are too often seen only as a problem within Europe. We want to prove that our new neighbours offer an opportunity for Europe to enrich its culture and empower its economy. Our aim is to help refugees to build and expand their qualification as software developers and provide them with valuable skills that will improve their chances on the labour market.</p>
<p>
With the help of volunteers organizations on the field, we wish to allocate donated laptops to refugees and provide them with high quality learning resources, which enable them to learn programming step by step by following clear instructions. IT-students or professionals will accompany and facilitate the learning process as mentors.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>
<p>Currently we are in planning the Refugees on Rails events in Leipzig.</p>

<h2>When</h2>
<p>After some planning events we know that we will start in August 2016.</p>

<h2>Where</h2>
<p>We found a good location for this events. It's the <a href="http://www.spinlab.co/">SpinLap</a>.</p>

<h2>Who is this for?</h2>
<p>Our mentorship meetings are meant for all interested refugees from the Leipzig region</p>
<p>You should have decent English/German skills and a strong interest in computers. Programming experience is very helpful and welcome, but not required. Everything else (laptops, location, drinks, etc.) will be provided by us.</p>
<p>If you want to come to our meetings, it would be nice if you <a heref="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdaXJCxmhhGIBCrN2kxFgu_jt8nTdM_TqcakMZaLIgJ4C7ybQ/viewform" title="registration form">register here</a>.</p>

<h1>Refugees on Rails / Leipzig</h1>

<p>Refugees are too often seen only as a problem within Europe. We want to prove that our new neighbours offer an opportunity for Europe to enrich its culture and empower its economy. Our aim is to help refugees to build and expand their qualification as software developers and provide them with valuable skills that will improve their chances on the labour market.</p>
<p>
With the help of volunteers organizations on the field, we wish to allocate donated laptops to refugees and provide them with high quality learning resources, which enable them to learn programming step by step by following clear instructions. IT-students or professionals will accompany and facilitate the learning process as mentors.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Foo</strong> Foo yeah</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Change the layout</strong>, which is the “default.html” file in the “layouts” directory, and create something unique (and hopefully less bland).</p></li>
</ul>
